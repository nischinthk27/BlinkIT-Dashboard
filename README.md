ðŸ“Š BlinkIT Sales & Business Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze BlinkITâ€™s sales and business performance. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics such as total sales, profit, orders, top-performing products, regional sales distribution, and customer purchasing trends. The dataset (8,524 rows) was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using Power Query and DAX to enable meaningful insights. Key visualizations include line charts for sales trends, bar charts for top products, pie charts for category-wise sales, maps for regional performance, and KPI cards for at-a-glance metrics.

The analysis highlights customer behavior patterns (e.g., weekend shopping spikes), regional performance differences, and profitability trends, helping in data-driven decision-making. Future improvements include real-time data integration, SQL-based data pipelines, and predictive analytics using machine learning.
